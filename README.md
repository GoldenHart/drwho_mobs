# drwho_mobs

0.0.1 Release

Adds mobs from the Doctor Who TV series.

This mod was inspired by lkjoel trying to bring the universe of Doctor Who to our beloved Minetest. He never finished the project and left the community, and GreenXenith revived the mod. I'm not smart enough to make the entire project, but using the mobs_redo API by TenPlus1 I am able to make some of the mobs. Currently, the Daleks and Cybermen are working. The Weeping Angels are in progress, but they will need a lot of work, and possibly some contributions from the community. Other mobs from Doctor Who will be made in future. The Weeping Angels are my primary concern right now.

If someone wants to make a better Dalek model, I am open to a contribution there. It is my beginner art model though.
The Cyberman skin was made by an anonymous user, and legally used by me.

Again, I'm not smart enough to do it all. If something in the mod looks bad, it probably is. But if you want something done and nobody else does it for you, you have one of two choices, make it yourself, or live without it. So I choose to try it myself. :P
